Do these results match what you found in your previous peer review? Why or why not?

It matches with SOME of the results we had in our previous peer review, as to why;  there were more than 5 vulnerabilites that the code had but it identified one we did'nt comment on. 


Do you think they caught all the vulnerabilities present in the code? Why or why not?

They did not catch all the vulnerabilities present in the code only mentioning a few, I think it only identifed some issues each containing a different reason of error, but if I 
think if I were to fix or add to troubleshooting the vulnerabilities it can maybe identify other ones afterwards once the three it firstly identified has been resolved.


Why is using multiple code scanners better than using one?

I see it as to why its always safe to double check your work, that reason applies to why it might be better using multiple scanners compared
to using one; one scanner can identify some issues but another might find other issues the other scanner did not pick up on.
